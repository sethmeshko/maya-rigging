This folder contains files containing objects needed for jfm rigging scripts.
For the scripts to work the files must be in a folder called "assets" in the same directory as the "scripts" folder.
Both of these folders should reside in the main maya user directory.  
So: C:\Users\User\Documents\maya
should contain a "scripts" folder by default and you will have to add the "assets" folder and place these files in "assets":

for jfm_hand_setup:
jfm_fkKnuckleControl.mb
jfm_leftHandControlBox.mb
jfm_rightHandControlBox.mb
jfm_transformControl.mb
