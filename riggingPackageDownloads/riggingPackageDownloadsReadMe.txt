This directory contains completed scripts with relevant assets bundled into zip files.
This is so you can download everything you need to run these scripts without trying to piece the assets and scripts together
from the git repository.

instructions:
Download the zip file for the script you want.
Place the zip file in the main maya user directory example: C:\Users\User\Documents\maya
unzip the file. 
The unzipping process will populate the "scripts" folder and "assets" folder.
Run the scripts by loading them in from the script editor in maya.
