This directory contains the actual rigging scripts.  It is intended to mirror the main maya "scripts" folder in the 
computer of the user, e.g. C:\Users\User\Documents\maya

However, this is a working directory that is available for people to review and make changes to the scripts that may improve the
functionality.  Simply copying a script from here may not result in a functional script as other assets may be needed for the script's use.

If you aren't interested in contributing but simply want the finished script with all of its necessary components then download the complete scripts with related assets in a zip file in the downloads directory in this repository.
